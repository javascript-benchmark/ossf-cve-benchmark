# Frequently asked questions

## General

### Why do I have to run the benchmark myself? Can't you host the data somewhere?

Anyone should of course feel free to publish the results of their own benchmarking efforts! And indeed, we might do that ourselves at some point in the future. But before we do so, we'd like to work on a few other things, and we'd love your help. For example, we'd love to expand the number of security tools that are integrated into the CVE Benchmark through a [tool driver](analysis-tools.md). We'd also like to make doubly-sure that the existing drivers invoke their security tools in the right way. Last, but not least, we'd like to make sure that we don't upset anyone by publishing these results. Let's work together to build awesome security tools!

### How do I get in touch?

Please take a look at our [Contributing guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md). If you'd like to join the OpenSSF Security Tooling working group, please [take a look here](https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling). If that's not what you're looking for, feel free to open an issue with your question.

## Data

### Why is `CVE-2020-99999` not in [CVEs](CVE) dataset?

Probably because no one has added it yet. If you'd like to add a CVE to the dataset,
please open a pull request with data that satisfies the requirements of
[benchmark-CVEs](benchmark-CVEs.md).

### Why is `src/server.js:789` of `CVE-123-456` not listed as a weakness?

Probably because no one has identified that yet. Please add it in a pull request, including data that satisfies the requirements of
[benchmark-CVEs](benchmark-CVEs.md).

### Why is commit `abcd123` not the `postPatch` of `CVE-123-456`?

Probably because it only is a partial fix. Please open a pull
request or issue to discuss it.

### Why is the weakness and alert format so elementary?

One of the main advantages of using a very simple data format is to make it easy for anyone to contribute!

The purpose of this project is not to describe the weaknesses and
alerts in detail â€” that is a job for the individual security analysis tools
in their favorite UI environments. Our JSON data format does allow for
external references (URLs) that can point to such explanations.

The purpose of this project is to facilitate easy comparison of the
alerts from different benchmark tools, and a simple data format for
weaknesses and alerts ensures everyone can contribute.


## Drivers for security tools

### Why is there no support for security analysis tool X?

There ought to be! For information about adding support for 
a new analysis tool, see [Analysis tools](analysis-tools.md). We'd love to see a pull request!

### Why is the driver for analysis tool X not using feature Y?

It probably should. Please open a pull request that improves the
driver for X. Thanks!

## Selectors

This section is a cookbook for selecting CVEs of interest.  The
answers can be piped to command such as `run` and `report` like this:
`bin/cli list ... | bin/cli run ... -`.

### How do I select all CVEs?

```
$ bin/cli list '*'
```

### How do I select a specific CVE?

```
$ bin/cli list CVE-123-456
```

### How do I use a custom list of specific CVEs?

```
$ bin/cli list ... > my-cves.txt
$ cat my-cves.txt | bin/cli run ... -
```

### How do I select all CVEs except for `CVE-123-456`?

```
$ bin/cli list '*' | bin/cli filter --invert-match CVE-123-456
```

### How do I select CVEs from 2019 and 2020 that are about XSS (CWE-79)?

```
$ bin/cli list CWE-79 | bin/cli filter year:2019 year:2020
```

### How do I select CVEs with CWEs in the MITRE top 25 list from 2020?

```
$ bin/cli list mitre-cwe-top:25:2020 | bin/cli filter year:2019 year:2020
```


## Reports

### Why does report X not show Y?

That could be a very good idea! Please open an issue to discuss this further, and hopefully we can collaborate on a pull request!

### Why does report X classify Y as a true positive?

Reports generally rely on the simple heuristic that an alert on the same
line as a known weakness is a true positive. If a driver uses a
security rule that happens to result in an alert on a line with a weakness, even
though the rule technically is irrelevant for the CVE in question,
then that is erroneously regarded as a true positive. The driver should only make
use of relevant alerts.
