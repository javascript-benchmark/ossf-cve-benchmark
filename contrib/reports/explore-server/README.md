# contrib/reports/explore-server

Generates reports that compares the results of different tools against
the known weaknesses. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities and
recognize patches.

On the vulnerable commits, the report categorises alerts as true
positives if they occur on the same line as a known weakness. A true
positive alert means that the analysis successfully identified the
vulnerability of the CVE.  If an analysis uses irrelevant queries, it
may unfairly get credited with a true positive.

On the patched commits, a rough heuristic is applied to spot the
analyses that recognize the patch. The heuristic is satisfied if the
alert count decreases between the vulnerable and patched commit for
any of the queries that had a true positive alert on the vulnerable
commit. A large refactoring of the code base may invalidate this
heuristic, but it works out very well in general.

## Development

This is implemented as a basic nodejs [server](src/server/index.ts)
and a basic [React application](src/client/client.tsx), which is built
with [webpack](webpack.config.js). 

During development, it is recommended leave the following commands
running in the background:

```
npx webpack --watch --config contrib/reports/explore-server/webpack.config.js 
```
and
```
bin/cli report --kind server '*'
```
