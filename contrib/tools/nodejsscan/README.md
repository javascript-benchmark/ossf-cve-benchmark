# contrib/tools/nodejsscan

This directory contains the driver for running the
[`njsscan`](https://github.com/ajinabraham/njsscan) analysis tool
which internally is used by the
[`nodejsscan`](https://github.com/ajinabraham/nodejsscan) solution.

## Installation

To make use of this driver, install `njsscan` on the local machine
(guide at https://github.com/ajinabraham/njsscan itself).

```
pip3 install -t my-directory njsscan
```

## Configuration

To make use of the installed `njsscan`, add a config file tools entry
that points to the directory used in the Installation section above:

```json
{
  ...
  "tools": {
    ...
    "nodejsscan-default": {
      "bin": "node",
      "args": [
        "/home/user-name/ossf-cve-benchmark/build/ts/contrib/tools/nodejsscan/src/nodejsscan.js",
      ],
      "options": {
        "njsscanDir": "/home/user-name/analysis-tools/njsscan"
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```
```

This will allow you to use the tool-id `nodejsscan-default` in `cli/bin run
--tool nodejsscan-default`.

## Supported versions

[njsscan.ts](src/njsscan.ts) has been tested with the following
versions of [`njsscan`](https://github.com/ajinabraham/njsscan): `0.1.8`.
